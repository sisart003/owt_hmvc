# WHAT IS HMVC IN CODEIGNITER

HMVC stands for Hierarchical Model View Controller. Modular Extensions make the Codeigniter PHP framework modular. Modules are groups of independent components, typically model, controller and view, arranged in an application modules sub-directory that can be dropped into other Codeigniter applications. This allows easy distribution of independent components (MVC) in a single directory across other CodeIgniter applications.
